## Tips

### Overview

A few general tips and guidelines on how to make a character and break down the main game practices. 

### General tips 

* Take it a step at a time. Rome wasn't built in a day. 
* Write your ideas down to have a better scope of your project and minimize the mental load in the long run.
* Give yourself reasonable objectives to achieve (i.e "Today I will design 3 cards", "I want to code 5~10 cards this week"). Those numbers may vary depending on your free time and programming experience.
* If you are not making any progress, take a break for as long as necessary. 
* Set your priorities. Having a functional mod is much more important than worrying about smaller details that would take considerable times to adjust or implement.

### Cost-value ranges

#### Base values
| Cost | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4+ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Attack | 6~8 | 8~10 | 12~18 | 15~24 | 20~30 |
| Attack(AoE) | 5 | 7 | 14 | 16~18 | 18~25|
| Defense | 5~6 | 6 | 10~13 | 12~18 | 15~30 |
| Draw | ~ | 1 with upside/2 | 2~3 with upside | ~ | ~ |
| Graze | ~ | 1 with downside | 1 with upside/2 with downside | 2 with upside | ~ |

#### Upgrade bonuses
| Cost | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4+ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Attack | +3| +3~5 | +5/Cost -1| +6/Cost -1| +8~+10/Cost -1|
| Attack(AoE) | +2 | +3 | +4~5 | +4/Cost -1| +6|
| Defense| +3 | +3~4 | +3~5/Block to Barrier | +4~6/Block to Barrier/Cost-1| +8~10/Cost-1 |
| Draw | ~ | +1 Card/Cost-1 | +1 card/Cost-1 | ~ | ~ |
| Graze | ~ | Remove Downside | +1 Graze/Better Upside/Remove downside | Cost -1 | ~ |

#### Notes
* Rare cards and cards that require multiple mana of a specific color can typically go a bit higher in terms of value. For instance, Red Giant Impact deals 18 damage for a 2 mana card with an upside.
* Abilities are harder to evaluate as they are highly-context dependent.

### Mechanics

* The main game characters have around 2~3 main theme (i.e Unstable Potion/Burst/Retain for Marisa) and up to ~5 keywords (i.e Scry, Burst, Charge, Overdrive, Retain, Concentration for Marisa).
* Make the mechanics easily understandable.
* Don't overdo it. Introducing too many mechanics may make the character too complicated and/or too synergy-dependent to work properly.
* Plan synergies and see how the character's different mechanics could intertwine for multicolor builds and 2-color cards.
* The common card that comes with the starting deck or the starting exhibit should be simple and introduce the color's mechanics.
* Not every cards need to use a custom mechanic, some simple generic cards can work well on the character. 
* Planning synergies with some of the neutral in-game cards may help (Sakuya having access to discard cards in Blue; Cirno having access to Midsummer Flowers in Green).
* Balancing can be quite complicated due to the nature of the in-game and the enemies gimmicks. Beware of the potential difficult match-ups and plan alternative solutions (i.e Few multi-hit attacks against Lunarian Rabbits; Low-damage characters against Tenshi; Combo-centric characters against Remillia).

### Color themes

The in-game colors tend to follow certain themes.

* White: Defense, Upgrade, Exile, Card generation
* Blue: Draw, Discard, Copies, Extra Turns
* Black: Debuffs, High-risk/reward, Poison
* Red: Attacks, Firepower, Multi-hits
* Green: Mana generation, X-cost cards, Echo, Teammates

Please note that those are general themes and that there are exceptions. For instance Cirno's Refreshing Breeze is a defensive card that Upgrade cards in the hand while that is more of a White-gimmick.

### Exhibits

* Exhibits can either provide long-term value (Yin-Yang Orb, Mini-Hakkero) or immediate value (Dark Grimoire, Ice Crystal Wings).
* Do not make a character's gimmick entirely dependent on the starting Exhibit as they can be traded in Act 1.
* If you intend to make the exhibit available to other characters via the act 1 boss, make them generic enough to be usable on other characters.
  
### Ultimate Skills / Bombs

* Deal up to ~45 damage to one target with no effect (Reimu R bomb). Deal ~25 damage as an AoE (Marisa R, Cirno A).
* Should have synergies with the character's color mechanics. For instance, it could add the character's main Token card to the hand/draw pile (Marisa B, Sakuya A)
  
### Cards

#### Type distribution

For reference, the in-game type distribution as of 1.5.1 is:

| Character | Reimu | Marisa | Sakuya | Cirno |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Attack | 22 | 17 | 16 | 17 |
| Defense | 11 | 15 | 9 | 8 |
| Skill | 23 | 20 | 31 | 24 |
| Ability | 14 | 15 | 11 | 12 |
| Teammate | 1 | 1 | 1 | 9 |

#### Rarity distribution

For reference, the in-game rarity distribution as of 1.5.1 is:

| Character | Reimu | Marisa | Sakuya | Cirno |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Common (including basic) | 18 | 18 | 19 | 19 |
| Uncommon | 34 | 32 | 30 | 32 |
| Rare | 19 | 18 | 19 | 19 |

#### General 

Some patterns can be observed in the in-game characters' card collections. Certain type of cards are present on multiple characters or even on both of the characters' colors. Please note that those are simply observations and not guidelines to follow at all cost.  

This can be used as inspiration to adjust a character's card pool. 

* One of the common card that comes with the starting deck should cost 2 mana of a specific color.
* 1~2 Token cards.
* 1 Common 2-color card.
* 1 Common 1-mana draw card (Ascension Kick, Travel Preparation, On Thin Ice).
  
* 1 Uncommon Attack that adds itself back from the discard pile to the hand whenever the player uses one of the character's mechanics (Dimensional Point Rift, Navigation Star, Time Stop Detective).
* 1 Uncommon Ability that provides Firepower (Dance of Sacred Sakura, Light the Furnace, Time Stop Detective(Meant as a replacement, see 1.5.1 Patch note), Flammable Ice).  
* 2 Uncommon/Rare Attack cards that get stronger the more the character uses one of the character's mechanics (Fist of the  Hakurei, Barrier Slam, Stardust Reverie, Firework Potion, My Knife's Recursion).

* 1~2 Uncommon/Rare Skill cards that Exile cards in hand to generate Tokens/gain a buff. (Hand Warmer, Waste Utilization, Changeling Magic, Frozen Specimen).    
* 1~2 Uncommon/Rare Ability that generates Tokens at the start of each turn (The Birth of Yin-Yang, Astrology Study, Fluorescent Forest, Starry Sword Dance, Frozen Throne).
* 2 Uncommon/Rare Ability that provides Block/Barrier/Character-specific type of defense when one of the main mechanics is used (Reverse Boundary, Edge of Fantasy, Silver Dimension, Fairies' Abode, Frozen Matrix).
* 2 Rare 5-mana Ability cards with a high-payout (Fantasy Seal-Worn-, The Great Hakurei Barrier, Refine Potion, All Out, Dazzling Dash, Frozen Matrix, Mental Energy Injection).
* 1 Common/Uncommon/Rare card with an healing effect. That card should either have Exile (Slice of Life, Sake Offering, Mushroom Feast, Lily White Herald of Spring) or the healing should be on a Debut effect (Tea Brewing).
* 1 Uncommon/Rare X-Cost card (Expanding Border, Rainbow Star Blast, Starlight Convergence, Perfect Servant). Cirno used to have an X-cost card in the beta but it was later removed and reworked.
  
* 2~3 Graze cards (Maiden's Aerial Dance, Tiny Hitbox, Rocket Broom, Shoot the Moon, Run Away, Private Vision, Accidental Dodge, Meiling Neglectful Gatekeeper, In Plain Sight, Fairy on Ice)
* 1 Rare Off-color Ability that bridges two of the character's main mechanics (Radioactive Element, You are Next!, Ever Cool Seasonal Fantasia).
* 1 Teammate card (Usually Off-color). Cirno is an exception as it is one of her main mechanics.
* 1 Extra Turn Card (Usually in White/Blue). Sakuya is an exception as it is one of her main mechanics.
